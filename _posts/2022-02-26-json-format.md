JSON stands for `JavaScript Object notation`. As the name suggests, it takes origin in JavaScript, but now it is a language-agnostic standard defining a data structure. It allows you to work with APIs, structure data, create config files, and more. It is very easy to read and understand, making it easy to learn and so popular.

This tutorial is using JS to visualise examples and starts with the primitive data types: 
- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- object
- array. 

Then we dig deeper into the objects and arrays, their structure, and the ways to traverse them in code using dot or square bracket notations.
