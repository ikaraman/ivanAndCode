Accessibility or a11y is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible. This video explains what is accessibility, why you need to worry about it, and how to start actually evaluating "is my website accessible or not?".

In this video we will go through:
- the test tips for using automation tools like Google Chrome Lighthouse or other browser extensions
- introduction into the `accessibility tree`, why it is important for the screen readers and an overall accessibility
- introduction to `WCAG spec` (web content accessibility guidelines) and a little tutorial on how to make sense of it
  
Also, we understand, on a high level, why you **cannot** only rely on automation tools when evaluating accessibility compliance but require `manual testing` involving a skilled human.
