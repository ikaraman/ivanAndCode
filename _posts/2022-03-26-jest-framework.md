Jest is awesome! It has mocks/spies, test coverage, before/after hooks, assertion library and is very easy to use. Authors of the Jest speak about it as `A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity`. So, if you are learning how to create unit tests in JavaScript, this tutorial is for you!

This video is not a comparison of different test frameworks for Node.js, like "Mocha" vs "Jest" vs "Jasmine". Instead, we try to use the simple `FizzBuzz` program as an example to demo most of the Jest features. This tutorial is aimed at beginners, but even js-masters might find certain things useful. 

Sit tight and let's learn how to write unit tests!
