How to test "an object" is a question that is sometimes being asked during an interview. Sometimes about testing a pencil, sometimes about a pen, sometimes it’s a soft drink vending machine, doesn’t matter. 

This video tutorial is not focused on `how to pass an interview` or `what interviewer expects and wants to hear`, but about understanding and learning a practical approach to testing and generating test ideas.

Using pencil as an example, we will look into:
- generating test cases
- visualising test coverage and gaps in testing
- show you a practicality of building a mindmap (using [XMind](https://www.xmind.net/))
- some tips and tricks that could help you along the way
- next steps of moving into actual exploratory testing and running test missions

If you are the interviewer who uses this exercise, I apologise for this video. But I know you can be creative and change you task to a “how to test a cup of tea” to see if my viewers learned something ;)
