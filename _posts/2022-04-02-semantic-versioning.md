`Semantic versioning` or `SemVer` is a public contract between producers and consumers of the software on “how to name versions” of a software. It's been proposed to make versioning predictable.

- When you are creating new software (package, or public API), you want to communicate in the easiest way what kind of changes your customer will get.
- When you are consuming the software, your goal is the same, get what you need without unexpected side effects.

This video explains the semver format (major, minor & patch versions), explains the practicality of each (breaking changes, non-breaking new features & bug fixes), and gives tips for devs who create & developers who consume the software.
