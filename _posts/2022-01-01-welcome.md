Hello, reader!  
My name is Ivan Karaman, also known as "ivanAndCode".  

Here I write about:
- testing
- quality
- software development
- processes and practices
- all other fascinating things related (or not) to software development and don't fit into a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ivan_karaman).

Happy reading! ðŸ˜Š  
Ivan Karaman.
