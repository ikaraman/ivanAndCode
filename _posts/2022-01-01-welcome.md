Hello, reader!  
My name is Ivan Karaman, also known as "ivanAndCode".
![Avatar of Ivan Karaman](../assets/ava_300px.jpg)  
Here I write about testing, quality, and all other interesting things related (or not) to software development and don't fit into a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ivan_karaman).

If you prefer "video over text" check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ivanandcode/videos)

Happy reading! ðŸ˜Š  
Ivan Karaman.
