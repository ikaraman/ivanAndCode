Hello, reader!  
My name is Ivan Karaman, also known as "ivanAndCode".  

Here I write about testing, quality, and all other fascinating things related (or not) to software development and don't fit into a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ivan_karaman).

If you prefer `video over text`, check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ivanandcode/videos)

Happy reading! ðŸ˜Š
