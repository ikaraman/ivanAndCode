Hello, reader!  
My name is Ivan Karaman, and here I write about testing, quality, and all other interesting things related (or not) to software development and don't fit into a [tweet](https://twitter.com/ivan_karaman).

If you prefer "video over text" check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ivanandcode/videos)

Happy reading! ðŸ˜Š  
Ivan Karaman.
