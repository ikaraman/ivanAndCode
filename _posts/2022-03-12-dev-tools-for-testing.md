Chrome developer tools is an amazing addition to the browser that allows you to make your webapp testing `way more effective and efficient`. 
This video will show you how to start using it for your daily testing routine, highlighting hidden yet helpful features.

The scope of this video is only the toolbar of the Google Chrome browser. Some of the other browser's toolbars, for instance, Firefox and Safari, could behave differently and not have some of the features, but most of them should match.
