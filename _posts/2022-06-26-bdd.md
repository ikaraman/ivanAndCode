This video is about BDD or Behavior Driven Development. We discuss what BDD is. What are some of behaviour-driven development key attributes, like:
- Three Amigos
- why BDD can be applied when writing unit tests (even though most of the time it's about end-to-end, or UI-level testing)
- Gherkin syntax (or given-when-then syntax) and parallels with arrange - act - assert style.
- the difference with TDD (or test-driven development) - why BDD is not the same as Cucumber or Specflow
- history (the idea of BDD came from Daniel Terhorst-North, who published an article about it in 2006, you could read it here: https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/)
