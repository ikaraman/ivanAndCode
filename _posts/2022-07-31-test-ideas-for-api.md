Struggle with "where to start" with API testing? This video is for you!
We will explore five areas for testing, along with generating some test ideas for further expanding your test coverage.

Those areas are:
- errors
- performance
- middleware (or filters)
- security
- contract

For contract testing, we will look into a sample contract document, how it's structured and describes all of the API endpoints, payloads, headers, etc. For this demo OpenAPI spec of the Swagger "petshop" is going to be used.
