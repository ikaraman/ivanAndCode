TDD approach is very simple. You start with "what if", aka the unit test. Then you run the test to see it fails. Then you write the code to make it pass.... and repeat the classic red-green-refactor cycle.

In this video you'll see a practical comparison of the "implementation first" approach VS "Test-Driven Development" or "TDD" approach for unit testing.
Indeed, it is often faster to create implementation without tests, but then there are concerns of:
- adding the tests after and having to refactor your `non-testable` application
- `not adding them at all` because of the work pressure
- creating technical debt, aka `complicated piece of code nobody wants to touch` (too scary)
